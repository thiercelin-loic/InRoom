#Room

This is a library for inter-function or inter-class communication in your JavaScript. The idea is based on "humanitarian mnemonics", imagine there is a room and many people can talk or leave messages on table. Anyone who says something into the room will be heared by others. There are more to it, will write later.

```javascript
room.say('hello')
room.listen('hello', function() { 'someone says hello' })
}
```
